efficient: with no runtime or garbage
collector, it can power performance-
critical services, run on embedded
devices, and easily integrate with other
languages.

model guarantee memory-safety and
thread-safety  enabling you to eliminate
many classes of bugs at compile-time.
Productivity
Rust has great documentation, a friendly
compiler with useful error messages, and
top-notch tooling an integrated
package manager and build tool, smart
multi-editor support with auto-
